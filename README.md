# Orbit
### FBLA Mobile App Development SLC - 2024-2025
### Saugus High School
### Team: Aaryan Patel, Rajeev Hotlani, Vanshika Nayani

# Description
**Orbit** is a cross-platform mobile application on iOS and Android that takes learning out of this world! Whether it is blasting asteroids or endlessly wandering the streets of a historical site, Orbit is an app dedicated toward making academia easy to approach and fun to engage with!

Our goal for *Orbit* is to provide a platform where students, whether experienced or a novice, will be able to develop, improve, and test the skills needed to not only ace a new test, but build on a career and interest for the future and beyond.

Through a user-friendly GUI and a clean look, *Orbit* encourages students to actively participate and see how much they actually know about FBLA. Images of the graphic user interface can be found [here](https://github.com/kinzorPark/FBLA-Mobile-App-Development/blob/master/GUI.pdf). Considering the presence of social media in our daily lives, we've made it easy to not only capture the greatness in your learning, but to spread it to those around you via Instagram.
